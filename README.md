# Bash scripts

Collection of bash scripts i wrote for different uses.

## index

1. [Noob menu](https://github.com/Squar3wave/bash_scripts/tree/master/noob_menu) - a simple and kind of crude YAD-based graphical menu to help users not familiar with tiling window managers navigate them. Yeah, I know, the name is VERY funny.
2. [VNC double monitor]()
